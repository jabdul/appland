# **Appland** #


Appland's goal is to provide an end-to-end UI development framework and work-flow for developing modern and traditional style web applications. Great emphasis has been placed on assisting the developer to create **reusable** and **maintainable** modules adhering to industry standards along the way.

Appland helps you to incorporate popular frameworks and libraries into your projects including Backbone, jQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, SASS, Jasmine and many more.

### Key Features ###

* Module Scaffolding 
* Modular Development Architecture
* Modular OOCSS Framework
* Modular Unit Testing
* Build and Optimisation
* RESTful Mock Server
* Third-party Library Management
* Framework and Library Agnostic
* Admin Area for Monitoring and Managing Modules

### Basic workflow ###
Once Appland and its command-line interface (apln) have been installed, you can manage your projects (or modules) as easily as the following:

Create a basic scaffold for your module...

    $ apln create my-app
	
...and when you're ready for production, this will concatenate, optimise, minify your
JavaScripts and CSS into a distribution directory:

    $ apln build my-app
